# Group_4_Final_Project
## Topic
- The relationship between NBA player statistics and "peak" performance

## Reason for Selecting Topic
- We would like to build a model that when fed a number of different statistics can predict the number of games a player will play

## Source Data
- Our source data will be taken from Kaggle and includes NBA Players Stats since 1950 in the form of csv files
- For the purpose of our analysis we will only focus on years 1980-present as that is when the "modern" NBA began 


## Questions We Hope to Answer
- When is a NBA player's peak?
- At what point does a player's decline begin?
- What stats are indicators of peak performance?
- Are teams getting adequate value from the players they pay top dollar for?


## Communication Protocols
- Our group maintains a steady flow of communication through Slack and our Teams page to stay updated on the status of the project deliverables as well as to coordinate additional meetings outside of class time.
