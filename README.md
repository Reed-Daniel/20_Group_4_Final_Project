## Topic <a name="topic"></a>
- The relationship between NBA player statistics and performance over the course of the modern NBA

## Reason for Selecting Topic <a name="reason-for-selecting-the-topic"></a>
- We would like to explore statistical data to determine if the NBA has a base-line for it's athletes, how that base line weighs against the top performers throughout the decades, and if you can predict the number of games a player would play per season

## Source Data <a name="source"></a>
- Our source data will be taken from Kaggle and includes NBA Players Stats since 1950 in the form of csv files
- For the purpose of our analysis we will only focus on years 1980-present as that is when the "modern" NBA began 


## Questions to Answer <a name="questions-to-answer"></a>
- Does the NBA look the same decade by decade in terms of performance?
- What does a prototypical player look like in each decade?
	- How has that changed over time?
- Can you predict the number of games a player will play in a season based on their statistics?
	- Does decade have an impact of number of games played?

## Communication Protocols <a name="communication-protocols"></a>
- Our group maintains a steady flow of communication through Slack and our Teams page to stay updated on the status of the project deliverables as well as to coordinate additional meetings outside of class time.
